# GENetLib: A Python Library for Gene–environment Interaction Analysis via Deep Learning
## Introduction
GENetLib is a Python library that addresses the lack of portable and friendly software for analyzing gene-environment (G-E) interactions using a deep learning approach with penalization, as developed by Wu et al., 2023. It also tackles the challenge of high-dimensional SNP data analysis by employing a functional data analysis method that reduces data dimensionality, which builds upon with a G-E interaction approach proposed by Ren et al., 2023.
