# GENetLib: A Python Library for Gene–environment Interaction Analysis via Deep Learning
## Introduction
GENetLib is a Python library that addresses the lack of portable and friendly software for analyzing gene-environment (G-E) interactions using a deep learning approach with penalization, as developed by Wu et al., 2023. It also provides a functional data analysis moethod based on neural network framework.
