``GENetLib``: A Python Library for Geneâ€“environment Interaction Analysis via Deep Learning
================================================================================

``GENetLib`` is a Python library designed for gene-environment interaction analysis via neural network, addressing the analytical challenges in complex disease research. This package is capable of handling a variety of input data types:

- Scalar input data
- Functional input data (or densely measured data)

This package also supports diverse output requirements:

- Continuous output data
- Binary output data
- Survival output data

By integrating minimax concave penalty (MCP) and L2-norm regularization within a neural network estimation framework, ``GENetLib`` offers an innovative solution for high-dimensional genetic data analysis. The framework is shown below.

We provide a web-based documentation which introduces the meaning of function parameters, the usage of functions, detailed information about methods, and gives examples for each. The web page is available at `documentations <https://open-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This package has been uploaded to PyPI with previous versions, and the web page is available at `PyPI package <https://pypi.org/project/genetlib/>`_. Users can also check `tags <https://github.com/Barry57/GENetLib/releases>`_ to get historical versions.
